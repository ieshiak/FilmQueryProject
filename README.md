# FilmQueryProject
Film Query Application, developed by Ieshia Parker during Week 7 at Skill Distillery. This is a Java application that interacts with a MySQL database, enabling users to efficiently retrieve detailed information about films, actors, and many more details through a user-friendly interface.
# Description

This is a Java application that offers users a platform for querying and retrieving information pertaining to films. Using MySQL database, a system that delivers data related to films, details about actors, film attributes, and so much more. This java application's core features include the ability to look up films based on their unique IDs, search for films using keywords, and access in-depth information about a specific film. This detailed information includes essential aspects such as the film's description, release year, language, associated actors, and the availability of copies in the inventory. The application comprises four key classes: Actor, Film, DatabaseAccessorObject (which implements the DatabaseAccessor interface), and FilmQueryApp. To set up and run the application successfully, users need the Java Development Kit (JDK) and a MySQL Database. This combination of classes and features facilitates an interactive experience for users seeking comprehensive insights into film-related data.

The Actor class serves as a blueprint to the film database, encapsulating key details like the actor's ID, first and last name, and a list of films they participated in. The common getter and setter methods provide easy access to and customization of these details. The hashCode and equals methods ensure a smooth operation by determining equality based on the actor's ID, first name, last name, and filmography. The toString method, crafts a user-friendly string representation of the Actor object, presenting an readable summary.

The Film class is the central hub for film-related information, representing key details such as ID, title, description, release year, language, rental information, length, cost, rating, special features, and a list of associated actors. This class offers a comprehensive set of getter and setter methods for easy manipulation of these attributes. The hashCode and equals methods ensure efficient comparison and identification of film objects. The toString method generates a well-formatted string, presenting a detailed overview of the film's properties, actors, and special features. Additionally, a wrapText method is employed for neatly formatting multiline text within the description.

The DatabaseAccessor interface defines the contract for accessing a database, outlining methods to retrieve film and actor information based on various criteria. The DatabaseAccessorObject class implements this interface, providing the concrete implementation for interacting with a MySQL database. It establishes a database connection upon instantiation and contains methods such as findFilmById, findActorById, findActorsByFilmId, findFilmsByKeyword, and findCategoriesByFilmId, each tailored to fetch specific details from the database. The class employs SQL queries to extract and map data from the database into Java objects, creating instances of the Film and Actor entities. Additionally, the class features a closeConnection method for closing the database connection when necessary. This implementation ensures a flexible and modular approach to handling database queries for film-related information within the application.

The FilmQueryApp class represents a Java console application for querying film information from a MySQL database. It interacts with the database through the DatabaseAccessor interface, with the actual implementation provided by the DatabaseAccessorObject class. The application offers a menu-driven user interface, allowing users to perform actions such as looking up films by their IDs or searching for films based on keywords. Exception handling is incorporated to handle input validation. The methods within the class facilitate actions like retrieving detailed film information by ID, displaying all film details, and searching for films using keywords. The application also provides an option to view additional details for a specific film, including categories, actors, and inventory copies. Overall, the FilmQueryApp provides a user-friendly and interactive way to explore and retrieve film details from the connected database.

# Tech Used

GitHub was utilized for version control, allowing the continuous upload and display of code to showcase ongoing work and progress. The Zoom recordings, originating from the Skill Distillery boot camp, provided valuable insights through collaborative learning and discussions. Eclipse served as the integrated development environment (IDE) for Java programming, facilitating coding tasks. Git commands in the terminal were employed for version control operations. Additionally, MySQL database stored film-related data, including information about actors, film details, and inventory items, contributing to the functionality of the Java application.

# Lessons Learned

I discovered the importance of pacing myself and allowing time for learning tools to truly sink in. Initially, driven by the desire to excel in every aspect, I found myself overworking and not giving myself adequate time for comprehension. However, this experience has evolved my perspective, and I now approach assignments with a different mindset. Although I may still struggle with the precise terminology, I have developed a deeper understanding when I encounter code. 

Creating the DatabaseAccessorObject proved to be the most challenging aspect of the project, requiring focused practice with try and catch blocks to handle exceptions effectively. Implementing the interface methods posed a specific challenge in structuring the layout to display the desired information. To overcome these hurdles, I referred to snippets of code provided in the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) portion of the lesson, gaining valuable insights and enhancing my understanding of the required implementations. This experience highlighted the importance of continuous practice and resource utilization in refining coding skills.

One notable challenge during the early stages of developing this Java Application involved frequent crashes of Eclipse due to an infinite loop. However, utilizing GitHub for version control proved instrumental in backtracking and overcoming obstacles more efficiently. The addition of debug statements was crucial in the development process as they serve as invaluable tools for identifying and resolving issues within the code. Debug statements are placed within the lines of code that output relevant information during program execution. By inserting these statements, developers gain insights into the state of variables, the flow of execution, and potential errors. This positive experience has left me eager for future assignments with Skill Distillery, boosting my confidence in my evolving abilities.
